# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting Credit Card Fraud Detection using different machine learning models. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training/evaluation.  

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier


## Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 92.4%
- Random Forest Accuracy: 92.3%
- Best Performing Model: - Logistic Regression

  - performed Hyperparameter tuning to avoid overfitting.- Random Forest Classifier tends to overfitt
